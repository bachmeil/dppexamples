Reproduces two documentation examples, one on [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/poly.html)
and one on [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/multiroots.html#examples).

The first example uses a polynomial solver. To make and run the C program:

```
make poly-c
./poly
```

To make and run the D program:

```
make poly-d
./dpoly
```

The second example uses a multidimensional root finder. To make and run the C program:

```
make root-c
./root
```

To make and run the D program:

```
make root-d
./droot
```
